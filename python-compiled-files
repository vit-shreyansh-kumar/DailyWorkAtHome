Python is an interpreted language but it compiles the code too so, it cannot be a purely interpreted language.

Python uses caches and it caches the compiled module in the .pyc files.

CPython compiles the python code to the "byte code" and for the preformance it caches the
compiled code to the pyc files. It also caches when it finds change in the source code.
This, feature makes loading much faster because the compilation phase can be bypassed.


In python3, python import mechinary is executed to write and search for the byte code cache files,
in a single directory inside every python package directory. This directory is called as __pycache__ .
